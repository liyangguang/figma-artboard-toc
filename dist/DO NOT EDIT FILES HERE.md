DO NOT edit files under `/dist`.

These files are generated by compiling, and will be overwritten when compiling. Edit the source code file under `/src` and run compiling commands. See README.md for more details.

This folder is kept in git, only for users who don't have `node.js` to be able to load the plugin locally without running compiling.
